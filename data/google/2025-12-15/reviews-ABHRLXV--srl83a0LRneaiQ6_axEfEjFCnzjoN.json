    "comment": "Hoda is an amazing nail technician. I will not go and see anyone else for my nails. Hoda is a perfectionist and doesn\u0027t rush you, she takes her time and does an extremely professional job. I stopped getting my gel nails done a few years ago as I really didn\u0027t like the way other nail salons treated my nails. But that all changed when I found Luminous Nails. Hoda is very careful, gentle and ensures you are very happy with your nails when she has finished.",
