I received a reply with the date and time with a question mark to which I replied “thankyou that’s great” apparently that’s not a booking as she never sent a confirmation.\nI travelled from Mapleton to PalmView and totally wasted my time.\nPerhaps respond to your bookings and be a bit clearer.\nThese messages were sent on Monday when did you plan on confirming my booking",

Simply inquiring about availability does not guarantee an appointment.\nWhen you arrived. I was still happy to accommodate you despite not having received a confirmation from you. I strive to provide clear communication and professional service, and I apologise if there was any misunderstanding. I appreciate your feedback and will work on making my booking process even clearer in the future.",

      "comment": "I’m sad to hear you are disappointed. As you said yourself when you came in, your nails were not in good condition, since you had chewed off both the previous acrylic extensions and almost all of the real nails underneath.\n\nI recommended that you just get a manicure and let the nails grow before getting extensions, or I would have to glue them directly on your skin and it would not look good, but you chose not to do that. I then recommended you choose a natural colour that would better suit your nails in their current condition, and you instead chose pastel pink. However, I completely respected your decision to go ahead with the extensions and your choice of colour.\n\nWhile I always do my best to accomodate my clients wishes, there are limitations when working with damaged nails, as I explained at the time. I always ask my clients if they are happy with their nails, and if not I will fix them for free, either then or at another appointment, but you did not say anything.",
